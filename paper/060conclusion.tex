This paper studies a new problem, named topic taxonomy completion, which aims to complete the topic taxonomy initiated with a user-provided partial hierarchy.
The proposed \proposed framework performs the hierarchical discovery of novel sub-topic clusters;
it employs the text embedding and clustering tailored for effective discrimination between known sub-topics and novel sub-topics.
%presents a weakly supervised framework for topic taxonomy construction, named \proposed, which leverages a partial or incomplete hierarchy of topic surface names given as prior knowledge.
%To generate the complete topic taxonomy of an input text corpus, \proposed performs the hierarchical discovery of novel sub-topic clusters;
%it employs the text embedding and clustering tailored for effective discrimination between known sub-topics and novel sub-topics.
%For each topic node, terms are selectively assigned into one of its child nodes considering both their relevance and representativeness to each sub-topic.
The extensive experiments show that \proposed successfully outputs the high-quality topic taxonomy which accurately matches with the ground-truth topic hierarchy.

In future work, we would like to enhance the center term of novel topic nodes so that it can best summarize the high-level concepts of its sub-topic clusters.
To this end, it would be interesting to (i) incorporate relation extraction techniques and (ii) employ a pre-trained language model;
this could be a bridge technique between an entity taxonomy and a topic taxonomy, with a comprehensive understanding of entities, relations, documents, and topics.
