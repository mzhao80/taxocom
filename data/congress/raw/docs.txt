specifying system language tool hardware software engineer
book book teach write specification computer system using language rather long people read comprises first page contains engineer need know writing specification assumes basic background computing knowledge mathematics expected undergraduate studying engineering computer science contains advanced material sophisticated reader remainder book reference tool language world wide web page contains material accompany book including tool exercise reference literature list correction link web page http org specification writing nature way letting know sloppy thinking specification written description system supposed specifying system help understand good idea understand system building good idea write specification system implementing book specifying behavioral property called functional logical property property specify system supposed important kind property consider including performance property performance often expressed behavioral chapter explains specify system must react within certain length time however specifying average performance beyond scope method described basic tool writing specification mathematics mathematics nature way letting know sloppy writing hard precise imprecise language like english chinese engineering imprecision lead error avoid error science engineering adopted mathematics language mathematics use formal math grown formal mathematics nature way letting know sloppy mathematics mathematics written mathematician scientist really precise precise small imprecise large equation precise assertion read accompanying word understand equation relate one another exactly theorem mean logician developed way eliminating word making mathematics completely formal hence completely precise mathematician scientist think formal mathematics without word long tiresome wrong ordinary mathematics expressed compactly precise completely formal language take two dozen line define solution arbitrary differential equation differential equation module chapter specification need sophisticated mathematics require simple application standard mathematical concept specify system describing allowed course execution amir pnueli introduced use temporal logic describing system behavior principle system could described single temporal logic formula practice could pnueli temporal logic ideal describing property system awkward others usually combined traditional way describing system late invented temporal logic simple variant pnueli original logic make practical describe system single formula specification consists ordinary nontemporal mathematics temporal logic play significant role describing property good describing also provides nice way formalize style reasoning system proved effective style known assertional reasoning however book specification say almost nothing proof temporal logic assumes underlying logic expressing ordinary mathematics many way formalize ordinary math computer scientist prefer one resembles favorite programming language chose instead one mathematician one logician call logic set theory provides mathematical foundation describing system write specification need complete language built atop foundation initially thought language sort abstract programming language whose semantics would based know kind programming language construct would best start writing specification directly intended introduce programming construct needed surprise discovered need needed robust language writing mathematics although mathematician developed science writing formula turned science engineering discipline developed notation mathematics small mathematics large specification real system dozen even hundred page long mathematician know write formula formula introduce notation writing long formula took programming language idea modularizing large specification language came called refined course writing specification disparate system changed little last year found quite good specifying wide class program interface distributed system used write precise formal description almost sort discrete system especially well suited describing asynchronous system component operate strict book consisting chapter core book meant read beginning end explains specify class property known safety property property specified almost temporal logic engineer need know reading read much like chapter independent others temporal logic come fore chapter used specify additional class property known liveness property chapter describes specify property chapter describes write specification composition chapter contains advanced example three chapter serve reference manual three tool syntactic analyzer typesetting program model checker want use probably want use tool available web page sophisticated example web get started using read chapter learn use effectively reference manual language provides good enough working knowledge language purpose need look question fine point syntax semantics chapter give syntax chapter describes precise meaning general form operator chapter describes precise meaning construct definition together two chapter specify semantics

tcl toolkit
book tcl born frustration early student developed number interactive tool university california berkeley mostly integrated circuit design found spending lot time building bad command language tool needed command language sort main interest tool rather command language spent little time possible command language always ended language weak quirky furthermore command language one tool never quite right next tool ended building new bad command language tool became increasingly frustrating fall occurred solution build reusable command language scripting language could built library package perhaps could reused many different purpose many different application course language would need extensible application could add specific feature core provided library spring implement language result tcl also born frustration basic idea arose response apple announcement hyper card fall hyper card generated tremendous excitement power system way allowed many different interactive element scripted work together however discouraged hyper card system obviously taken large development effort seemed unlikely small group university researchproject could ever mount massive effort suggested would able participate development new form interactive software future concluded hope component approach rather building new application monolith hundred thousand line code needed find way divide application many smaller reusable component ideally component would small enough implemented small group interesting application could created assembling component environment possible create exciting new application developing one new component combining existing component approach requires powerful flexible glue assembling component occurred perhaps shared scripting language could provide glue thinking grew toolkit based tcl allows component either individual control entire application either case component developed independently tcl used assemble component communicate started writing tcl hobby spare time people began use system found spending time point occupy almost waking hour many sleeping one tcl succeeded beyond wildest dream developer community number ten thousand thousand tcl application existence development application area tcl cover virtually entire spectrum graphical engineering application including design software development testing instrument control scientific visualization multimedia tcl used many application tcl used together many others tcl used hundred company large small well university research laboratory one benefit came surprise possible create interesting graphical user interface entirely tcl script always assumed every tcl application would contain new code implement new tcl command plus tcl script combine new command facility provided tcl however simple application called wish became available many people began creating user interface writing tcl script without writing code turned tcl command provide interface programming hide many detail faced programmer result much easier learn use wish toolkit user interface written much code user never write code application consist solely tcl script book intended introduction tcl programmer plan write modify application assume reader programmed least passing familiarity shell csh ksh also assume reader used window system familiar basic idea using mouse resizing window prior experience tcl needed order read book need written application using toolkits motif book organized learn tcl without learning wish also discussion write tcl script discussion use library interface provided tcl
